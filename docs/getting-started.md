!!! note "Documentation in progress"
    The CLI and architecture are being reorganized (issues #146–#160). Detailed getting-started content will be written once the refactor stabilizes.

In the meantime, see the [README](https://github.com/Dorky-Robot/sipag#readme) for installation and quick-start instructions.
